# FunBic-CCA

**FunBic-CCA**: **Fun**ction Secret Sharing for **Bic**lusterings - **C**heng and **C**hurch **A**lgorithm: privacy-preserving gene expression data analysis by biclustering algorithm namely Cheng and Church Algorithm using secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) schemes, including additive secret sharing and function secret sharing in Python under the MIT license.

We apply:  
1. [Funshade](https://github.com/ibarrond/funshade) for IC (Interval Containment) gate of function secret sharing scheme in 2PC protocol
2. [Sycret](https://github.com/OpenMined/sycret) for DPF (Distributed Point Function) gate of function secret sharing scheme in 2PC protocol
